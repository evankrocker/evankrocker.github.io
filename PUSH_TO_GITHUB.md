# Complete the Push to GitHub

Your vinyl collection site is ready and committed to Git!

## What's Ready
âœ… All files are in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/vinyl-collection-site`
âœ… Git repository initialized
âœ… All files committed to 'main' branch
âœ… Remote configured: https://github.com/evankrocker/evankrocker.github.io.git

## To Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Using Git Command Line

1. Open a terminal on your computer
2. Navigate to where you download the vinyl-collection-site folder
3. Run the push command:

```bash
cd vinyl-collection-site
git push -u origin main
```

4. When prompted, enter:
   - Username: `evankrocker`
   - Password: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your password!)

### How to Get a Personal Access Token

GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations. You need a token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Jekyll Site"
4. Select scope: âœ… `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Option 2: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer not to use command line:

1. Go to: https://github.com/evankrocker/evankrocker.github.io
2. If the repo has existing files, you may need to delete them first
3. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
4. Drag ALL files from the vinyl-collection-site folder
5. Important: Make sure to include the `.gitignore` file
6. Commit directly to main branch

### Option 3: Give Me Your Token

If you're comfortable sharing a temporary Personal Access Token, I can push it for you. After pushing, you can delete the token.

## After Pushing

1. Go to: https://github.com/evankrocker/evankrocker.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to build your site
5. Visit: **https://evankrocker.github.io**

Your vinyl collection site will be live! ðŸŽµ

## Troubleshooting

**"Repository not found"**: Make sure the repository exists at https://github.com/evankrocker/evankrocker.github.io

**Authentication failed**: You need to use a Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password

**Files not showing up**: Make sure you uploaded ALL files including hidden files like `.gitignore`
